For long, the United States has witnessed skyrocketing maternal mortality and an increase in the rate of unnecessary Cesarean sections. Such unfortunate phenomena arguably originate from lack of consistent and objective interpretation of the pre-delivery CTG data. Therefore, to better facilitate the decision-making process of the clinicians, this project aims to construct an effective supervised learning model that classifies potentially pathological fetuses.
Through analyses of the 22 variables extracted from the CTG fetal heart rate data, several variables stand out as key indicators for fetuses at danger. The top three are the abnormal short-term variability, percentage of time with abnormal long-term variability, and mean value of short-term variability. The optimal model is a Random Forest model that yields an overall accuracy of 0.9443 and Pathological class F1-score of 0.9122.
With consistent and precise fetal heart rate tracking in the third trimester of pregnancy and accurate CTG processing, real-time classifications made with this model could support clinicians in determining fetal risk and subsequent need for Cesarean sections.
